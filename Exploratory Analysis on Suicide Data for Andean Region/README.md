The World Health Organization estimates that the Andean region has the highest rate of suicide in Latin America, with more than 10,000 suicides occurring in the region each year. Suicide is a significant public health issue and understanding the factors associated is essential for developing public policies and effective strategies. Mental health services play an important role in suicide prevention by creating a work environment that is conducive to wellness, providing resources for people to access if they are struggling, and promoting a culture of understanding and acceptance. In adittion, mental health professionals provide individuals specialized attention they need to cope with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. By offering counseling, psychotherapy, and other evidence-based treatments, they can help to break through barriers and find new perspectives on life. With this background, this exploratory analysis aims to discover if there is a relationship between the suicide rate by year and age, with the number of mental health professionals and services per 100,000 inhabitants in the Andean region, comparing these numbers with those of northern and southwestern Europe.
