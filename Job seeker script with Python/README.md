Job seeker python script
Script built in python that looks for employment options for the position of clinical psychologist on the web platform of the government of Ecuador. 
The script performs the search and returns a list with the most recent results, using filters for place and time of publication.
The libraries that were used were pandas to create the dataframe with the login credentials to the platform. 
Beautiful soup to read the information on the web and selenium to interact with it.
